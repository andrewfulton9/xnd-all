xnd-all combines all individual xnd libraries as git subtrees. This is a
convenience package that should facilitate developing and testing.

Note that ./configure is currently extremely limited, since it just calls
./configure in all libraries.  The only option is --prefix.  If --prefix
is omitted, the libraries are installed into $PWD/build.

The builds of libxnd and libgumath rely on previously installed libraries,
so an explicit "make install" is required.


The Python build is entirely separate from the library builds. Due to
limitations of distutils, libraries are installed together with the
C extensions.

Naturally the C extensions could be built against system-installed
libraries, but that has its own set of problems.


Install all libraries into $PWD/build
=====================================

./configure
make install
make check

# Valgrind
make memcheck


Install all libraries into /usr/local
=====================================

./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make install
make check

# Valgrind
make memcheck


Install all Python modules into $PWD/python
===========================================

python3 setup.py develop


Install all Python modules into site-packages
=============================================

python3 setup.py install
